# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this repository is to complete the peer-graded assignment "Getting and Cleaning Data" week 4.

# Course Instructions
Download and unzip files to a working directory

Create an one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
 # Course requirements - submit the following:
 
1) a tidy data set as described in step 5 above
2) a link to a Github repository with a script for performing the analysis called run_analysis.R
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.Â 
4) include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.
